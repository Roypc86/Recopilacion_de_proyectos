# Compilation of Most Important University Projects
Repository compiling the most important projects developed throughout the Computer Science degree program.

## Word Embedding with Word2Vec:
This project involves using Word2Vec artificial intelligence technology to develop a neural network that, based on accounting standards, can solve pairings with concepts extracted from the training set.

## Integrative Project for Operating Systems and Data Communication Networks:
The project involves creating an overlay network on top of an existing network, where the main nodes are logically connected following a topology of neighboring nodes, allowing communication and message passing through protocols implemented by the team. In other words, it enables sending messages from one machine and ensures the receiving device can correctly receive it.

## Pong with Deep Q-Learning:
For this project, a version of the Pong game was implemented. Pong is a game inspired by table tennis, in which players move their paddle vertically to make contact with a moving ball. The game's objective is to prevent the ball from touching the wall you're defending and to score more points than the opponent. The neural network must be able to defend the ball on either side.
